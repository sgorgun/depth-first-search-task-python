# Depth-first search (python)
Set of programming assignments that are designed to test knowledge of DFS (depth-first search), one of the graph traversal methods.

## Problem 1: Check if a (v, u)-path exist in a directed graph
Your first programming assignment is to implement DFS in order to check if a (v, u)-path exist in a directed graph. Vertices are enumerated from 0 to N-1, there N is the input number and equals to number of vertices. The second input parameter is an adjacency dictionary. Apart from it v and u are given.

## Problem 2: Check if an undirected connected graph is bipartite
Your task is to implement DFS in order to find whether or not the given graph is bipartite. Vertices are enumerated from 0 to N-1, there N is the input number and equals to the number of vertices. The second input parameter is an adjacency dictionary.

## Problem 3: Find the length of the longest eligible path in a directed acyclic graph
Given an N (number of graph vertices, which are numerated from 0 to N-1) and an adjacency dictionary, your task is to return an integer value, which reflects the length of the longest eligible path.
