# Depth-first search

## Purpose

The coding exercises are designed to test knowledge of the following concepts:

* The depth-first search traversal
* Applying the depth-first search traversal in practice

## Overview

The coding exercises cover the following practical problems:
* Checking if a (v, u)-path exist in a directed graph
* Checking if an undirected connected graph is bipartite
* Finding the length of the longest eligible path in a directed acyclic graph
